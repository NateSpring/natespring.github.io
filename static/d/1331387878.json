{"data":{"contentfulAbout":{"aboutMe":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"rawMarkdownBody":"I'm Nathan Spring, I love to build and learn! My background of customer-service and problem-solving has led me down a unique path in software development. I am fueled by my passion to help others through building web-apps to solve specific problems. My hunger for knowledge and determination to succeed has contributed to months of consistent learning and tackling intricate projects. The current technology stacks I'm using are: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS, React, jQuery, and Bootstrap; although I'm constantly learning new frameworks, libraries, and technologies. In my spare time I love to fix anything that comes my way, especially when it challenges how far I can think outside of the box. If you'd like to hear more about my journey as a self-taught web developer, please get in contact with me!"}},"profile":{"title":"Nathan Spring","image":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/bmiwg6mjh342/6nf3rNaaVaUqYcoAcciSeC/96968f513a735998c315601aadbab327/roundProfileMe.png?w=450&fl=progressive&q=100"}}}}}
