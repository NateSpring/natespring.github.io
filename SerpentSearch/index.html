            <h1>Rattlesnake info</h1>
            <p>Rattlesnakes are a group of venomous snakes of the genera Crotalus and Sistrurus[1] of the subfamily
                Crotalinae (the pit vipers). The scientific name Crotalus is derived from the Greek κρόταλον, meaning
                "castanet".[2] The name Sistrurus is the Latinized form of the Greek word for "tail rattler"
                (Σείστρουρος, seistrouros) and shares its root with the ancient Egyptian musical instrument the sistrum,
                a type of rattle.[3] The 36 known species of rattlesnakes have between 65 and 70 subspecies,[4] all
                native to the Americas, ranging from southern Alberta and Saskatchewan and southern British Columbia in
                Canada to central Argentina.

                Rattlesnakes are predators that live in a wide array of habitats, hunting small animals such as birds
                and rodents.

                Rattlesnakes receive their name from the rattle located at the end of their tails, which makes a loud
                rattling noise when vibrated that deters predators or serves as a warning to passers-by.[5] However,
                rattlesnakes fall prey to hawks, weasels, king snakes, and a variety of other species. Rattlesnakes are
                heavily preyed upon as neonates, while they are still weak and immature. Large numbers of rattlesnakes
                are killed by humans. Rattlesnake populations in many areas are severely threatened by habitat
                destruction, poaching, and extermination campaigns.

                Rattlesnakes are the leading contributor to snakebite injuries in North America. However, rattlesnakes
                rarely bite unless provoked or threatened; if treated promptly, the bites are seldom fatal. More
